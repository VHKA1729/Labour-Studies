## Cross Sectional Analysis of Unorganised Sector Workers in Urban Indian 


About 93% of the Indian workforce belongs to the unorganised sector as per the economic survey 2018-19. Thus, it directly affects the lives of a significant number of households in India. Moreover, the effect of the unorganised sector goes beyond these numbers, since a lot of firms in the organised sector rely upon the unorganised sector at different stages of their value chain. However, despite being so central to the well-being of the Indian economy and the populace, the sector does not receive enough protection via regulation and a lot of analysis is based upon theories developed for the organised sector. In this work we attempt to analyse the unorganised sector by means of a survey conducted on cab drivers, security guards, and housekeeping staff. We aim to study the relationships amongst different covariates captured via the survey questions as well as try to find the features that contain maximum information about the data.
